      "title": "Our Story",
      "description": "DOQI Company was founded in 1992 in Kosovo, during an extremely difficult period under the Yugoslav regime, when working conditions were very harsh. During 1998-1999, war broke out, which brought the destruction of everything we had built with dedication over the years. However, the great desire to work, unwavering will, and faith in the future pushed us to start from scratch, in a new reality, with great emotional and spiritual challenges. We did not give up. Year after year, with dedication and professionalism, we managed to rebuild the company, initially focusing on selling raw materials for furniture production, a sector with great development needs in our country. Thanks to seriousness and correctness, we became a trusted partner both inside and outside Kosovo, offering excellent services and quality products. Seeing the growing demand for imported mattresses, in 2011 we decided to invest and start producing them domestically. Thus, we created the StarFlex brand, which became known in the local market and beyond, distinguished for quality, flexibility, and fast service. In addition to mattress production, our company has also become an important supplier of raw materials for this industry, positioning itself as a market leader and an example of local success. In 2013, we also started cutting, edge banding, and CNC technology services, offering our customers opportunities to grow their businesses. These services are offered at low cost, with a clear purpose: raising local capacities to provide services at the country level, contributing to reducing imports and the economic development of Kosovo. This is the story of a company born from sacrifice, grown from dedication, and strengthened by determination. DOQI remains living proof that success is not accidental, but the result of passionate work and unwavering faith in our vision."
